# Number Analyzer (Day 10 Project)

A small Python project that analyzes a sequence of user-entered numbers using **functions**, **list comprehensions**, and **generator expressions**.  
Built as part of my daily Python learning journey.

---

## Features

This program:

- Accepts a list of numbers from the user  
- Returns a breakdown of:
  - All even numbers  
  - All odd numbers  
  - How many numbers are above a given threshold  
  - The sum of all numbers divisible by a given divisor  
- Uses:
  - Pure functions  
  - List comprehensions  
  - Generator expressions  
  - Dictionary-based reporting  
  - Clean modular code structure  

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Input parsing  
- Functional decomposition  
- List comprehensions  
- Generator expressions with `sum()`  
- Conditional filtering  
- Dictionary construction  
- Clean “main” execution pattern  

This code reflects the shift from beginner-style loops to **Pythonic patterns**, improving readability and efficiency.

##  How to Run

In your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python3 number_analysis.py
```

You will be prompted to:

1. Enter a list of numbers  
2. Enter a threshold  
3. Enter a divisor  

The program prints a formatted analysis report.

## Example Output

```
=== Number Analysis Report ===
Even numbers: [2, 6, 10, 12]
Odd numbers: [3, 5]
Numbers above threshold (5): 3
Sum of numbers divisible by 2: 30
```

##  About This Project

This script was created during **Day 10** of my personal Python learning journey.  
It demonstrates my transition from basic loops into real Python developer practices including:

- comprehension pipelines  
- multi-function design  
- structured reporting  

I use this repo to document my progress and reinforce clean coding habits.
