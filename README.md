# Number Analyzer (Day 10 Project)

A small Python project that analyzes a sequence of user-entered numbers using **functions**, **list comprehensions**, and **generator expressions**.  
Built as part of my daily Python learning journey.

##  Features

This program:

- Accepts a list of numbers from the user  
- Returns a breakdown of:
  - All even numbers  
  - All odd numbers  
  - How many numbers are above a given threshold  
  - The sum of all numbers divisible by a given divisor  
- Uses:
  - Pure functions  
  - List comprehensions  
  - Generator expressions  
  - Dictionary-based reporting  
  - Clean modular code structure

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Input parsing  
- Functional decomposition  
- List comprehensions  
- Generator expressions with `sum()`  
- Conditional filtering  
- Dictionary construction  
- Clean “main” execution pattern  

This code reflects the shift from beginner-style loops to **Pythonic patterns**, improving readability and efficiency.
